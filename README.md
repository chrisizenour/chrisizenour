- 👋 Hi, I’m @chrisizenour
- 👀 I’m interested in applying data science methods to sports and real estate. I am a passionate road cyclist and have within the last few years become a regular runner having completed two marathons (MCM in 2019 and Gettysburg North South in 2020) with more scheduled in the future. I also enjoy football, baseball. I am interested in using data science to better understand and predict outcomes in my sporting interests and act as an analyst on real estate for my wife.
- 🌱 I’m currently deepening my skills with Python and R.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to predicting sport performance and housing prices.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
